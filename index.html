              <h3>Campus Life</h3>
              <p>The campus grounds of M.A.M.A MU is a lively environment occupied by 23,000 to 25,000 aspiring Mathematicians and Artists. You will see and meet various kinds of people from different kinds of backgrounds all around the campus. Math students hauling books and papers studying all around for their tests, Art students sketching their surroundings on a canvas to capture the perfect depiction of an “Everyday Life”. The students are not only diligent and studious, but they’re also highly sociable, with M.A.M.A MU ensuring that we provide a space for students to converse, form groups, and have long-lasting friendships filled with memories during their stay in this University. 
        
                M.A.M.A MU takes our students’ studies very seriously, but that doesn’t mean that they are not allowed to have breaks in order to unwind. M.A.M.A MU holds a lot of events that cater to our students' hobbies and interests, with many being hosted by our students themselves. We have activities such as the freshie weeks where we openly welcome the freshmen in our university to gradually get them used to the campus and help them find groups and organizations that fit them well. There are also cultural events which celebrate different kinds of cultures for the students that came from that culture to study in our University. We strive to be inclusive of any groups in order to be welcoming of any talented students that may join our university and be able to create kind, open-minded, thoughtful, and progressive individuals that will drive innovation into our society and contribute their talents for the greater good of their people.  There are many more events and activities that you will be able to participate in once you join M.A.M.A MU, maybe you could host one yourself once you join our student council.
                
                We at M.A.M.A MU like to take part in thematic months such as October and December,  and we want it to be evident. That’s why, during thematic months, we try our best to decorate our campus to fit the theme and immerse our students on those holidays. The students themselves enjoy the changing environment, often offering to decorate or create a display to liven up the campus grounds. These requests are always welcomed with open arms by our faculty members, and the student council. Because of this, the campus is always very colorful and lively, enhancing the “campus life” for students and teachers alike.
